## Introduction

<img class="profile-picture" src="I.jpg">

Hi! I am Huang Wu, received the master’s degree in statistics from Anqing Normal University. I work on artificial intelligence in education currently. My current research interests include computer vision, human action recognition, and deep learning. You can see my simple academic introduction on [[IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086242899)].

**My research work, papers and related codes during my postgraduate period are hosted on GitHub for your reference.**

* You can find all my published papers on GitHub called [[KAR_Articles](https://github.com/vic9527/KAR_Articles)].

* You can find the full source code on GitHub called [[KAR_Tools](https://github.com/vic9527/KAR_Tools)].

* You can also find the resources I use in the lab on GitHub called [[苏门子弟](https://github.com/bysu2017)].

## Research

**My research work mainly has the following 2 innovation points.**

1) A method of human motion recognition based on hierarchical strategy is proposed. According to the hierarchical structure of human anatomy and the physical characteristics of human kinematics, combined with the thickness of action granularity, the method can recognize human actions in different layers, extract different motion features and select appropriate classifiers in each layer.

2) A method of human motion recognition based on self selection mechanism is proposed. In the process of classifier construction, in order to eliminate the influence of subjective factors such as human brain experience on classifier selection, an optimal classifier unit is designed, in which the common machine learning classification algorithm is used. Each classifier is trained by data to select the most suitable classifier.
